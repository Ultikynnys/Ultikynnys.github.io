										This time I decided to do two game jams at the same time. I cleared my whole week for this event, but it wasn't enough, to be honest I tried to carry one of the teams,
									but It wasn't enough. I'm never doing two again, since that the likelyhood of key people going missing is higher</p>

								<p>
									Now it's getting serious. At around 2022 I joined NBS, which gave me a better idea of working on bigger projects with more people. As to what I do? Well It's mostly the whole Modeling pipeline excluding creating the concept, but basically from nothing to a rigged alive thing(unless its a prop) Otherwise it's stuff like general VFX and game mechanic programming.</p>

									I made in total 2 deathrun maps, this was the second one that actually survived development hell. I learned that it's just safer to release something which is not ready, then polish it afterwards instead of  stressing over making something "perfect".</p>
