## Cover Letter Content

### Greeting_FI
Hei Remedyn tiimi,

### Greeting_EN
Hi Remedy Team,

### Introduction
I’m applying for the (Junior) Engine Programmer role at Remedy in Espoo. I like getting close to the metal. C/C++ has been my day to day at school and in projects, and I enjoy building practical tools that make designers and artists faster. Working on Northlight’s core is the kind of problem space I’m excited about. I haven’t worked inside a proprietary AAA engine yet, but I do have engine side experience in Unreal (C++). I learn fast, and growing inside Northlight feels like the right next step for me

### Body1
On the engineering side I keep things straightforward. Clear, testable C/C++. I profile first, then optimize. I’ve shipped stuff that shortens iteration and makes debugging boring (in a good way). A tiny C++ MP4 to WebP converter. Blender add ons artists actually use. I often pair Python with C/C++ via ctypes to speed up hot paths while keeping the edit run loop quick. Feels close to engine work: clean data transforms, solid serialization, tidy APIs, sensible memory/perf tradeoffs

### Body2
Because I also work in 3D production, I speak both languages: designer/artist and programmer, and I like being the glue. I write things down, keep changes small. I’m comfortable stepping into large codebases. I’m actively growing my multithreading skills and I appreciate focused code reviews. My goal is simple: ship features that scale and give developers great diagnostics and tooling

### Closing
I’d love to chat about how I could help on Northlight and Remedy’s next games. I’m based in Tampere and happy to relocate to Espoo (hybrid works too). Portfolio and GitHub are attached. glad to do a short C++ task or walk through prior work. I’m planning my B.Eng thesis for 2026 and would be keen to explore doing it with Remedy
